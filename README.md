# ImageMerger
Concatenate all images from a folder into a combined .jpg image. Images are concatenated following user defined inputs: rows, columns of the image map, starting corner and the direction of the next images.


Important Note:
- please add a ".mime.types" file into your User folder (Users/Your-user-name/ for Windows, and \home\Your-user-name\ for Linux) including the lines below, otherwise the program will refuse to work:

text txt text rtf TXT
image png tif jpg jpeg bmp

Disclamation:
This project is done with educational purpose and used to test functional features such as combo box with icons, packaged form sending, there is yet any hold back on performance stand point so the program will mostly run very costly. Performance revision will be done in later installment.
